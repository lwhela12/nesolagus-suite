## üé® Product Vision

### What Nesolagus Studio Is

**A creative survey design platform** that transforms research discovery documents into beautiful, branded conversational surveys.

**The Flow:**
1. **AI Kickstarts** ‚Üí Upload discovery/methodology docs, AI generates starter questions and structure
2. **You Create** ‚Üí Edit questions, add images/GIFs/avatars, customize theme and branding
3. **You Design** ‚Üí Build your analytics dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets
4. **You Preview** ‚Üí See exactly what your users will experience (100% WYSIWYG)
5. **You Deploy** ‚Üí One click to production with everything ready to go

### Core Principles

**1. AI Assists, Humans Create**
- AI generates a solid starting point from your discovery documents
- You polish, enhance, and add creative flourishes
- You control every detail - the AI just saves you hours of initial setup

**2. Creative Expression**
- Upload images, GIFs, and avatars to bring questions to life
- Full theme customization (colors, fonts, spacing, branding)
- Make your survey feel like a conversation with a real person
- Every survey is unique and on-brand

**3. WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get**
- The preview in Studio is exactly what users will see
- No surprises after deployment
- Test interactively before going live
- Dashboard preview matches production analytics

**4. Extensible & Future-Proof**
- Built-in question types: text, choice, scale, ratings, video, etc.
- Easy to add new types: audio, file upload, signatures, custom types
- Plugin architecture ready for custom question types
- Evolves with your needs

**5. One-Click Deploy**
- When you're satisfied with your beautiful survey, deploy it
- Complete client repository or auto-deploy to Vercel
- Survey + dashboard ready for users immediately
- No manual configuration or file copying

### What Makes It Different

**Traditional Survey Tools:**
- Start from scratch every time
- Limited customization
- Generic, boring UX
- Analytics as an afterthought

**Nesolagus Studio:**
- AI-powered starting point from your discovery docs
- Unlimited creative control (media, branding, themes)
- Conversational, engaging UX with avatars and personality
- Custom analytics dashboard built alongside survey
- Multi-client deployment architecture built-in

### Success Definition

A survey created in Nesolagus Studio should:
- ‚úÖ Take **hours, not days** to build (AI generates structure)
- ‚úÖ Feel **custom and on-brand** (user adds creative touches)
- ‚úÖ Match **preview exactly** when deployed (100% fidelity)
- ‚úÖ Have a **beautiful dashboard** ready at launch
- ‚úÖ Support **future enhancements** (new question types, features)

---

### ‚ùå **MISSING / NOT STARTED**

#### 1. Asset Upload & Management üî¥ **CRITICAL GAP**
**Priority:** Highest
**Impact:** Blocks creative expression

**What's Missing:**
- Image upload UI in block editors
- Avatar upload system
- Asset storage integration (Vercel Blob, Cloudinary, or S3)
- Asset library/picker
- Image optimization pipeline

**Current State:**
- `MixedMedia` question type exists and supports media conceptually

  ```typescript
  interface QuestionTypePlugin {
    type: string;
    name: string;
    icon: React.Component;
    EditorComponent: React.Component;
    RuntimeComponent: React.Component;
    validateConfig: (config: any) => ValidationResult;
