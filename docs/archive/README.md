- Standalone Next.js 15 app
- Dashboard components and examples

## üìù Why These Were Archived

These documents served their purpose during active development but became outdated as the project evolved:

1. **Multiple sources of truth** - Having several planning docs caused confusion
2. **Outdated status** - Phase completion docs showed old snapshots
3. **Superseded plans** - Original Phase 2 plan didn't match actual implementation
4. **Duplicate content** - Studio PRD duplicated main PRD with inconsistencies
5. **Dead code** - nesolagus-dashboard was prototype code no longer in use

---

## üìö Active Documentation

**Current planning and status:**
- `/Complete-Studio-Roadmap.md` - **Single source of truth** for Studio development
- `/README.md` - Main repository documentation
- `/docs/PRD.md` - Product requirements document (reference)
- `/docs/DESIGN.md` - Technical architecture document (reference)

**User guides:**
- `/studio/README.md` - Studio setup and usage
- `/engine/README.md` - Engine setup and deployment
- `/scripts/README.md` - Integration scripts

---

## üóìÔ∏è Archive Date

**Archived:** January 18, 2025
**Reason:** Documentation consolidation - created Complete-Studio-Roadmap.md as single source of truth

---

## üí° Using Archived Docs

These documents can be useful for:
- Understanding historical project decisions
- Reviewing what was originally planned vs. what was built
- Learning about the evolution of the architecture
- Onboarding context for new team members

**However:** Do not treat these as current - they may contain outdated information. Always refer to the active documentation for current status and plans.
