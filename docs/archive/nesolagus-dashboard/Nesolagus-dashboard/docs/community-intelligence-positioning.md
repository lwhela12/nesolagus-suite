## Market Positioning

### What We Are
**Community Voice Specialists** - We deliver authentic, scaled community engagement data that forms the foundational intelligence for strategic planning initiatives.

### What We're Not
- Full-service strategic planning consultants
- Quantitative analysis firms  
- Infrastructure or zoning specialists
- Everything-to-everyone generalists

### Our Unique Value
We solve the **"community engagement gap"** that causes strategic plans to fail. While technical consultants excel at analysis and frameworks, they struggle to capture genuine community voice at scale.

## Value Proposition to Prime Contractors

### The Problem We Solve

### Our Solution

### Specific Deliverables
- **Comprehensive stakeholder archetype analysis** mapping all interested parties (residents, business owners, non-profit leaders, politicians, unhoused individuals, artists, commuters, entrepreneurs, educators, institutions, and community advocates)

- **Multi-stakeholder sentiment analysis and priority mapping** across all community constituencies  
- **Inclusive engagement documentation** demonstrating outreach to all interested parties for RFP compliance
