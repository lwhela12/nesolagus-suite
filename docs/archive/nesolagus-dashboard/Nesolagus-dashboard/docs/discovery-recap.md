# The Studio: GHAC Donor Engagement Initiative

Discovery Summary & Project Outline

Prepared for: Greater Hartford Arts Council  
Prepared by: Nesolagus Team  
Date: June 2025

## 1. Executive Summary
This discovery brief synthesizes key insights from our workshop with Greater Hartford Arts Council (GHAC) stakeholders and outlines our strategic approach for developing a custom donor engagement conversational tool. The project aims to transform GHAC's understanding of their 23,000-person donor base, moving from anonymous transactions to informed, intentional relationships that strengthen the arts ecosystem across Greater Hartford and the additional 34 towns represented by GHAC.

Key insights to inform our approach:
- GHAC is at an inflection point — ready to reimagine their role from perceived “pass‑through funder” to active catalyst for the arts.
- Donor intelligence is minimal — despite a large database, personal connections and insights are limited to a small fraction.
- Reactivating lapsed donors is a priority — particularly former workplace campaign participants who may have untapped passion for the arts.
- Messaging clarity is needed — understanding what resonates (individual impact vs. collective good) will shape future communications.
- Bold repositioning is timely — GHAC's leadership transition and the volatile funding landscape create opportunity for reinvention.

Our approach introduces an innovative framework — “The Studio” — reimagining the conversational tool experience as a creative collaboration rather than a transactional data collection exercise.

## 2. Project Vision & Goals
### Project Vision
Create an engaging survey experience that positions donors as creative collaborators in shaping Greater Hartford's artistic future, generating actionable insights that help GHAC build authentic relationships and diversify their funding base.

### Core Project Goals
1. Transform anonymous relationships into informed, intentional partnerships.  
2. Understand donor motivations: why people give, what holds them back, and what would deepen their engagement.  
3. Identify engagement opportunities: board membership, volunteering, legacy giving, arts ambassadorship.  
4. Reactivate lapsed donors: re‑engage former supporters, especially workplace campaign participants.  
5. Refine messaging & positioning based on what resonates.  
6. Build pipeline for major gifts: identify capacity and readiness.

## 3. Discovery Insights
### Current State Challenges
- Limited donor knowledge: “Anonymous pool of donors... Amanda knows only a small portion after 10 years.”  
  Implication: Need comprehensive profiling approach.
- Perception as “pass‑through”: Seen primarily as corporate/foundation fund distributor.  
  Implication: Elevate direct impact stories.
- Workplace giving decline: Former Travelers campaign donors have lapsed.  
  Implication: Opportunity to reactivate with new approach.
- Unclear value proposition: Don’t know what messaging resonates with different segments.  
  Implication: Survey must test narratives.
- Reactive fundraising culture: Operating in “the old way” vs. proactive engagement.  
  Implication: Project can catalyze cultural shift.

### Organizational Transformation Vision
GHAC leadership is ready to “rethink everything,” including:
- Reimagining what it means to “live as an artist” in Greater Hartford.  
- Building entrepreneurial strategies into nonprofit operations.  
- Creating multi‑generational artist incubators.  
- Developing advocacy for arts as essential (not luxury).  
- Expanding partnerships beyond traditional arts sector.  
- Supporting for‑profit arts businesses as critical ecosystem components.

Key initiatives discussed:
- Street Stages: Artist activation program paying performers $200/hour at businesses across towns.  
- Skills Development Series: Capacity‑building workshops (sponsorship potential).  
- Regional Expansion: Serving all 34 towns more equitably.

### Key Stakeholder Quotes
- “We have actual insights into who they are. Turning them into intentional, lasting relationships... understanding their networks and sphere of influence.”
- “This is a radical act of community building, it's not charity. We are more than a pass‑through... WE DO SHIT!”
- “We help teach artists how to live as an artist.”
- “When you TRULY incorporate who they are and their backgrounds into their everyday discussions and classroom culture, they come alive.”

### Manufacturing Sector Model
Connecticut’s “Make it in CT” campaign offers a template:
- Workforce development and pipeline creation.  
- Economic impact and job creation.  
- Business sustainability and growth.  
- Export of products/talent beyond state borders.

Applied to arts:
- Artists as essential workforce.  
- Arts orgs as businesses (nonprofit and for‑profit).  
- Creative economy as economic driver.  
- Talent retention as competitive advantage.  
“People come to work for you because there's arts and culture here... You're going to retain your employees if it's a thriving arts ecosystem.”

## 4. Strategic Approach: The Studio Experience
A conversation, not a form. We aim to:
- Reduce survey fatigue through thoughtful, engaging design.  
- Position donors as partners in shaping GHAC's future.  
- Test messaging themes to learn what resonates.  
- Create authentic dialogue that builds relationships.  
The specific creative framework and messaging will be developed during the Build phase based on the approved question framework.

## 5. Target Audiences & Segmentation
### Primary Segments
- Current Active Donors (~2,000–3,000): Understand motivations, deepen engagement, identify major gift prospects.
- Lapsed Donors (past 5 years): Priority for reactivation; understand attrition reasons.
- Workplace Campaign Alumni: Former corporate participants; activate latent interest.
- “Creative Minds” Extended Network: Arts‑curious community members inside companies; potential new donor pipeline.

### Key Questions to Answer
- Why do they give (or stop)?  
- What impact matters to them?  
- Which stories resonate?  
- What would deepen connection?  
- Who has capacity for major gifts?  
- Who’s ready for board/volunteer roles?  
- How can we activate their sphere of influence?

## 6. Implementation Plan
### Technical Approach
- Platform: Custom‑built experience (platform TBD).  
- Access: Vanity URL on partner domain.  
- Distribution: Email (10,000 targeted), QR codes, social media.  
- Goal: 20% response (2,000 participants).  
- Privacy: Full anonymity option; opt‑in for follow‑up.  
- Data: Raw CSV export; explore integrations with existing tools.

Framed as “The Studio” — a place where creative minds collaborate — this work will generate the insights needed to sustain the arts ecosystem for years to come.
