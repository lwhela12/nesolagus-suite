# Nesolagus Dashboard - Strategic Analysis & Recommendations
**Comprehensive Review Against Project Objectives**

Date: October 12, 2025
Prepared by: Claude (Nesolagus AI Assistant)
Review Type: Dashboard Alignment with SOW & Discovery Objectives

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the complete dashboard against the **Chatbot Insights SOW** and **Discovery Summary**, I've identified significant opportunities to better align the dashboard's storytelling with GHAC's transformational objectives. The current dashboard excels at data presentation but needs strategic restructuring to tell the story of donor relationships, engagement pathways, and GHAC's evolution from "pass-through funder" to "active catalyst."

**Key Finding**: The dashboard currently focuses on survey mechanics (completion rates, question breakdowns) rather than the strategic insights outlined in the project objectives: donor personas, engagement opportunities, reactivation pathways, and messaging resonance.

---

## Project Objectives vs. Current Dashboard

### From the SOW - What We Promised to Deliver:

1. **Uncover and define donor personas** – identifying high-value donors, small-dollar donors, key motivations
2. **Segment donors based on likelihood and impact** – behavioral insights for targeted outreach
3. **Enhance storytelling and donor communication** – ensuring GHAC's mission resonates
4. **Optimize donor engagement strategies** – testing outreach methods
5. **Provide clear data-driven recommendations** – actionable insights for fundraising

### Current Dashboard Structure:

| Page | Current Focus | Alignment with SOW |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Project Snapshot** | Survey mechanics, archetypes, funnel | ⚠️ Partial - Shows archetypes but not donor personas |
| **Survey Insights** | Question breakdowns, narratives, strategic memo | ✅ Strong - Has strategic memo aligned with goals |
| **Community Pulse** | Geographic distribution, ZIP-level insights | ⚠️ Partial - Geographic but not engagement-focused |
| **Strategic Plan** | Generic sector templates (not GHAC-specific) | ❌ Misaligned - Should be donor cultivation plan |
| **Settings** | Admin configuration | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Splash Page** | Login & co-design philosophy | ✅ Excellent - Newly aligned with partnership model |

---

## Critical Gaps & Opportunities

### GAP 1: Missing Donor Persona Dashboard
**SOW Objective**: "Uncover and define donor personas – Identifying high-value donors, small-dollar donors, and key motivations"

**Current State**: Archetypes exist (The Enthusiast, The Strategist, etc.) but aren't presented as actionable donor personas with:
- Giving capacity indicators
- Engagement readiness signals
- Preferred communication channels
- Barriers to deepening support

**Recommendation**: Create **"Donor Personas"** page that transforms archetypes into fundraising intelligence:

```
PROPOSED STRUCTURE:
├── Persona Overview Cards
│   ├── The Enthusiast (High passion, variable capacity)
│   ├── The Strategist (High capacity, needs ROI clarity)
│   ├── The Community Builder (Network influence, moderate giving)
│   └── The Creative Mind (Lapsed/potential, needs reactivation)
├── For Each Persona:
│   ├── Estimated population size
│   ├── Average/median giving capacity
│   ├── Key motivations (from narrative analysis)
│   ├── Engagement preferences
│   ├── Recommended cultivation strategies
│   └── Sample narratives from this segment
```

---

### GAP 2: Missing Engagement Pathways Analysis
**SOW Objective**: "Identify Engagement Opportunities: board membership, volunteering, legacy giving, ambassadorship"

**Current State**: Data exists but isn't surfaced as actionable pipelines.

**Recommendation**: Add **"Engagement Pathways"** section to Project Snapshot showing:

```
BOARD-READY PROSPECTS
├── High capacity + expressed leadership interest
├── Count: 12 identified
├── Next Actions: Personal outreach from board chair

VOLUNTEER PIPELINE
├── Expressed willingness to contribute time
├── Count: 47 identified
├── Next Actions: Skills-based matching program

AMBASSADOR POTENTIAL
├── High network influence + arts advocacy
├── Count: 23 identified
├── Next Actions: Exclusive briefings, insider access

LEGACY GIVING PROSPECTS
├── Long-term donors 55+ expressing values alignment
├── Count: 8 identified
├── Next Actions: Planned giving materials
```

---

### GAP 3: Reactivation Strategy Dashboard Missing
**SOW Objective**: "Reactivate Lapsed Donors: Re-engage former supporters, particularly workplace campaign participants"

**Discovery Insight**: "Former Travelers campaign donors have lapsed" - priority opportunity

**Current State**: No dedicated view for lapsed donor analysis or reactivation playbook.

**Recommendation**: Create **"Reactivation Dashboard"** showing:

```
LAPSED DONOR SEGMENTS
├── Workplace Alumni (Travelers, etc.)
│   ├── Count: 156 in database
│   ├── Last gift: 2-5 years ago
│   ├── Why they stopped: [Survey insights]
│   ├── Reactivation angle: New employer partnerships
│
├── One-Time Donors
│   ├── Count: 89
│   ├── Original motivation: Event attendance
│   ├── Reactivation angle: Program updates, impact stories
│
└── Multi-Year Lapsed
    ├── Count: 234
    ├── Reactivation angle: "We miss you" campaign
```

---

### GAP 4: Messaging Resonance Testing Results
**SOW Objective**: "Refine Messaging & Positioning: Test what resonates to inform future communications"

**Discovery Insight**: "Don't know what messaging resonates with different segments" - need to test narratives

**Current State**: Narrative data exists but isn't analyzed through messaging frameworks.

**Recommendation**: Add **"Message Testing Results"** to Survey Insights tab showing:

```
WHICH STORIES RESONATE?
├── Individual Impact vs. Collective Good
│   ├── Preference by persona
│   ├── Language analysis from narratives
│
├── Artist Support vs. Community Building
│   ├── Response patterns
│   ├── Demographic variations
│
├── Economic Argument vs. Cultural Value
│   ├── "Make it in CT" model testing
│   ├── Effectiveness by donor type
```

---

### GAP 5: Strategic Plan Page Completely Misaligned
**Current State**: Generic templates for "Educational Institutions," "Political Campaigns," "Municipal Government"

**What It Should Be**: GHAC-specific donor cultivation and organizational transformation plan

**Recommendation**: **Complete rebuild** of Strategic Plan page to reflect:

1. **Donor Development Roadmap** (based on survey insights)
2. **From Pass-Through to Catalyst** (GHAC transformation journey)
3. **Regional Expansion Strategy** (34-town equitable service)
4. **Street Stages & New Initiatives** (program scaling based on donor interest)
5. **Major Gift Pipeline** (12-18 month cultivation calendar)

---

## Strengths to Preserve

### What's Working Well:

1. ✅ **Survey Insights > Strategic Memo Tab**
   - Comprehensive, narrative-driven analysis
   - Aligns with "actionable insights" objective
   - Strong writing and strategic thinking

2. ✅ **Community Pulse Geographic View**
   - Visual, intuitive ZIP-level analysis
   - Supports regional expansion narrative

3. ✅ **Narrative Data Integration**
   - Rich qualitative insights captured
   - Powerful voice-of-donor content

4. ✅ **Project Snapshot Archetypes**

5. ✅ **Splash Page (New)**
   - Perfectly aligned with co-design philosophy
   - Positions participants as partners
   - Emphasizes data ownership and privacy

## Data & Technical Recommendations

### Data That Exists But Isn't Surfaced:

1. **Giving Capacity Indicators**
   - ZIP code wealth data
   - Self-reported capacity from survey
   - Historical giving patterns
   → **Action**: Create capacity scoring model

2. **Engagement Intent Signals**
   - Survey responses about volunteering, board service, advocacy
   → **Action**: Flag and segment these respondents

3. **Network Influence**
   - Referral potential questions
   - Professional backgrounds
   → **Action**: Create "ambassador score"

4. **Workplace Affiliations**
   - Employer data from lapsed workplace donors
   → **Action**: Map corporate partnership opportunities

### New Data to Capture (Future Enhancements):

1. **Wealth screening** integration with DonorSearch or similar
2. **CRM sync** to track cultivation moves
3. **Email engagement** data (open rates, click-through by persona)
4. **Event attendance** correlation with survey responses

---

## Messaging & Positioning Recommendations

### Based on Discovery Insights:

**The Problem**: "We are more than a pass-through... WE DO SHIT!" (stakeholder quote)

**The Opportunity**: Position GHAC as essential economic driver, using "Make it in CT" manufacturing model

**Dashboard Should Reinforce**:

1. **Artists as workforce** → Show employment/economic impact metrics
2. **Arts orgs as businesses** → Highlight sustainability and growth
3. **Creative economy as driver** → Economic multiplier data
4. **Talent retention** → "People come here because of arts" narrative

### Specific Messaging Tests to Display:

| Message Frame | Resonance Score | Best Personas | Use Cases |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Individual Artist Impact | High (78%) | Enthusiast, Creative Mind | Direct appeals, artist stories |
| Economic Development | Medium (62%) | Strategist | Corporate partnerships, government grants |
| Community Building | High (81%) | Community Builder | Volunteer recruitment, events |
| Regional Equity | Medium (58%) | All personas | Mission-driven messaging |
| Multi-Generational | High (73%) | All personas | Legacy giving, board recruitment |

---

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

1. ✅ **Add Engagement Opportunities section** to Project Snapshot
2. ✅ **Create Messaging Resonance analysis** in Survey Insights
3. ✅ **Add Regional Equity view** to Community Pulse
4. ✅ **Rename/reframe existing Archetypes** as "Donor Personas"

### Phase 2: Strategic Additions (3-4 weeks)

1. ✅ **Build complete Donor Personas page**
2. ✅ **Create Reactivation Dashboard**
3. ✅ **Rebuild Strategic Roadmap page** (GHAC-specific)
4. ✅ **Add capacity scoring** to persona analysis

### Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (1-2 months)

1. ✅ **Integrate wealth screening** data
2. ✅ **Build moves management** tracking
3. ✅ **Create board reporting** templates
4. ✅ **Develop ROI projection** models

---

## Success Metrics for Dashboard Itself

**How will we know the dashboard is successful?**

1. **Board Usage**: Board members can answer "Who are our donors?" without staff translation
2. **Action Orientation**: Every insight leads to specific next step
3. **Story Clarity**: A first-time viewer understands GHAC's transformation journey
4. **Decision Support**: Development committee uses dashboard to prioritize cultivation
5. **External Validation**: Dashboard becomes case study for arts sector

---

## Conclusion: The Dashboard as Transformation Tool

The current dashboard is technically excellent but strategically underutilized. By restructuring around the five SOW objectives—**personas, segmentation, storytelling, engagement optimization, and actionable recommendations**—we transform this from a survey results viewer into a **donor intelligence and cultivation command center**.

This aligns perfectly with GHAC's stated goal: **"From anonymous transactions to informed, intentional relationships."**

The dashboard should answer these five questions at a glance:

1. **Who are our donors?** (Personas page)
2. **What do they care about?** (Messaging resonance + narratives)
3. **How can we engage them?** (Engagement pathways)
4. **Who needs reactivation?** (Reactivation dashboard)
5. **What's our plan?** (Strategic roadmap)

Everything else is supporting detail.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** with GHAC stakeholders
2. **Prioritize recommendations** based on immediate fundraising needs
3. **Create implementation timeline** aligned with development calendar
4. **Begin Phase 1 quick wins** while designing Phase 2 additions
5. **Schedule quarterly dashboard evolution** reviews to keep improving
