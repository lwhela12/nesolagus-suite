2025-09-06 16:29:39.751721,Anonymous 14,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,"[Text Answer] I have very positive feelings toward GHAC, but I  have talked to artists who feel like it is a bit clicky and that there isn't as much transparency or consistency as there can be. Maybe small group meetings with different stakeholders coming together to learn about the current mission and priorities, understand past successes and challenges and the reasons for certain changes in policies and focus over time and then a discussion. Unfortunately such relationship building takes time when we are all so busy actually programming and promoting what we are already doing....but it is a crucial step in helping those programs become more successful and the community to feel whole.",,
2025-09-06 00:14:19.782976,Anonymous 13,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,"[Text Answer] There needs to be balance between engaging artists outside of the community and local creatives. What I would like to see is more efforts to collaborate between arts communities. I would also like to see less siloed activity. Not everyone needs to be involved in everything, but I believe a community thrives when there is consistent communication and there are options for how to contribute to the success of what is happening. Local artists also need more opportunities for professional development. We should be preparing our local artists to be ready to work with the more widely recognized arts organizations in our region. It seems like many artists get overlooked because they don't know how to engage the organizations. It also seems like organizations need to engage artists in more meaningful ways.",,

I know at times that can be like herding cats, but it feels too often like GHAC is another arts organization fighting for my time and attention, rather than an organization making it easier for me to connect with the variety of fantastic arts organizations that are patron focused",,

This event supports the creative economy in so many ways, (food, (which many organizations consider an art form), music and art).",,

What I have heard, is that in the last few years, GHAC has been more about promoting its own brand and less of a solid source of funds that especially small arts organizations depend on.",,
