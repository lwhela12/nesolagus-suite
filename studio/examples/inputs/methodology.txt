Methodology Document: Acme Corp Employee Engagement Survey
==============================================================

Survey Approach
---------------
This will be a conversational, narrative-based survey that balances quantitative ratings with qualitative open-ended responses. The survey should feel personal and engaging, not corporate or transactional.

Question Framework
------------------

Section 1: Overall Satisfaction & Engagement (Foundation)
- Overall job satisfaction rating (1-5 scale)
- Engagement level / enthusiasm about work
- Likelihood to recommend Acme as employer (eNPS style)
- Open: What's working well? What could be better?

Section 2: Hybrid Work Experience (Recent Change)
- Current work arrangement (remote/hybrid/office)
- Satisfaction with work arrangement
- Impact on productivity
- Open: Hybrid policy improvements or concerns

Section 3: Team & Collaboration (Connection)
- Connection to team members
- Effectiveness of communication
- Support from manager
- Open: What would improve team dynamics?

Section 4: Benefits & Perks (Recent Implementation)
- Awareness of new benefits
- Satisfaction with benefits package
- Which benefits matter most (multi-select)

Section 5: Career & Development (Growth)
- Clarity on career path
- Access to learning opportunities
- Open: What would accelerate your growth?

Section 6: Priorities & Future (Action-Oriented)
- Top priorities for improvement (multi-select, up to 3)
- Likelihood to still be at Acme in 1 year
- (Conditional) If low retention: What would make you stay?
- Open: One thing to change if you could

Question Types to Use
---------------------
1. Scale/Rating Questions (1-5)
   - Overall satisfaction
   - Agreement statements (strongly disagree to strongly agree)

2. Single Choice
   - Work arrangement (remote/hybrid/office)
   - Role type

3. Multiple Choice
   - Important benefits (select up to 3)
   - Top priorities for improvement (select up to 3)

4. Open Text
   - "What's working well?"
   - "What would you improve?"

5. Conditional/Branching Logic
   - If satisfaction < 3: "What would improve your satisfaction?"
   - If retention likelihood low: "What would make you more likely to stay?"

Tone and Voice Guidelines
--------------------------
- Conversational: "How are you feeling about..." vs "Rate your satisfaction with..."
- Direct: "What could we do better?"
- Human: Use "we," "you," avoid third-person
- Appreciative: Thank for time investment

Design Principles
-----------------
1. Progressive disclosure: Don't show all questions at once
2. One question at a time: Focus attention, reduce cognitive load
3. Visual variety: Mix question types to maintain engagement
4. Progress indication: Show % complete throughout
5. Mobile-first: Design for thumb-friendly tapping

Branching Logic
---------------
- Low satisfaction (1-2) → Follow-up: "What would most improve your satisfaction?"
- Low retention likelihood → Follow-up: "What would make you more likely to stay?"

Duration Management
-------------------
- Target: 5-8 minutes
- Estimated time per question type:
  * Rating/scale: 10-15 seconds
  * Single choice: 15-20 seconds
  * Multiple choice: 20-30 seconds
  * Short text: 30-45 seconds
  * Long text: 60-90 seconds
- Limit open-ended questions to 5-6 maximum

Archetypes to Design For
-------------------------
1. The Skeptic: Needs anonymity assurance, direct questions
2. The Enthusiast: Wants to share detailed feedback, appreciates open-ended
3. The Busy Professional: Needs fast, efficient survey experience
4. The Mobile User: Requires thumb-friendly design
