Generate a complete survey configuration in the engine's final JSON format.

# INPUT DOCUMENTS
${sources.map(s => `## ${s.title}\n${s.text}`).join('\n\n')}

# PARAMETERS
- Client: ${client}
- Maximum Duration: ${maxMinutes} minutes
- Tone: ${tone.join(', ')}
- Anonymity: ${anonymity}
${params.segments ? `- Target Segments: ${params.segments.join(', ')}` : ''}
${params.archetypes ? `- Archetypes: ${params.archetypes.join(', ')}` : ''}

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return JSON with this structure:
{
  "survey": {
    "id": "client-slug-timestamp",
    "name": "Survey Title",
    "description": "Brief description of survey goals",
    "metadata": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "generatedAt": "ISO date",
      "generatedBy": "question-generator",
      "estimatedMinutes": number
    }
  },
  "blocks": {
    "b0": { ... first block ... },
    "b1": { ... second block ... },
    ...
  }
}

# BLOCK ID CONVENTIONS
- Main questions: b0, b1, b2, b3, etc. (sequential, always numerical)
- Branch blocks from b1: b1a, b1b, b1c, b1d (alphabetical suffixes)
- Branch blocks from b2: b2a, b2b, b2c
- All branches from b1 rejoin at b2 (next main question)
- All branches from b2 rejoin at b3

Example flow structure:
b0 (intro) ‚Üí b1 (choice: relationship to org)
  ‚Üí if "Donor": b1a (personalized ack) ‚Üí b2
  ‚Üí if "Volunteer": b1b (personalized ack) ‚Üí b2
  ‚Üí if "Board Member": b1c (personalized ack) ‚Üí b2
b2 (next main question) ‚Üí b3...

Rules:
- b0 is always the intro message
- Last block before end should be thank you message
- Router blocks not needed - put conditional logic directly on question blocks
- Branch blocks always use letter suffixes (a, b, c, d...)

# VARIABLE NAMING
- Ratings: rating_N (e.g., rating_3, rating_7)
- Single choice: choice_N
- Multi choice: multi_N
- Text input: text_N
- Number: num_N

# QUESTION TYPES & TIME ESTIMATES
- dynamic-message: auto-advancing message (~5 seconds)
- text-input: open-ended text (~30 seconds)
- single-choice: radio buttons (~15 seconds)
- multi-choice: checkboxes (~20 seconds)
- scale: rating scale with emojis (~10 seconds)
- final-message: survey end (no time)

# CONDITIONAL BRANCHING
Use the "next" field with this format for branching:

{
  "next": {
    "if": [
      {
        "when": { "lt": 5 },
        "goto": "b3"
      },
      {
        "when": { "gt": 7 },
        "goto": "b5"
      }
    ],
    "else": "b6"
  }
}

Condition operators (all compare against the current block's answer):
- { "lt": N } - less than (for rating/scale questions)
- { "gt": N } - greater than (for rating/scale questions)
- { "equals": "value" } - equals (for choice questions)
- { "in": ["val1", "val2"] } - includes any of these values

WHEN TO BRANCH:
- Analyze the documents to understand when branching adds value
- Add branches to acknowledge responses and ask relevant follow-ups
- Examples:
  * Low rating (1-4) ‚Üí acknowledge concern + ask what to improve
  * High rating (8-10) ‚Üí acknowledge positively + ask what they enjoyed
  * Multi-choice about interests ‚Üí branch to deeper questions per topic
  * Single-choice about role ‚Üí branch to role-specific questions
- Personalized acknowledgments make surveys feel more engaging and human
- Use your judgment - simple questions can stay linear, but meaningful acknowledgments enhance connection

BRANCHING FLOW:
- After branch follow-ups complete, they should rejoin the main survey flow
- Set branch terminal nodes' "next" to continue to the next main question (e.g., b1a ‚Üí b2, b1b ‚Üí b2)
- All branches from the same question (b1a, b1b, b1c) should merge at the same next question (b2)

# PERSONALIZED ACKNOWLEDGMENTS (IMPORTANT!)
After choice-based questions, provide thoughtful acknowledgments that reflect the user's specific answer. This makes surveys feel personal and validates the respondent's identity/role.

CHOICE QUESTIONS - Create branches for meaningful options:

Example: "What's your relationship to our organization?"
- If "Donor" ‚Üí b1a: "Donors are the lifeblood of our organization. Thank you for all you do!"
- If "Volunteer" ‚Üí b1b: "We're so grateful for volunteers like you who make our work possible."
- If "Board Member" ‚Üí b1c: "Thank you for your leadership and dedication to our mission."
- If "Staff" ‚Üí b1d: "We appreciate your commitment to our day-to-day mission."
(All ‚Üí b2: next question)

Example: "What best describes your role?"
- If "Property Owner" ‚Üí b3a: "Property owners like you are essential to downtown's vitality."
- If "Business Leader" ‚Üí b3b: "Thank you for investing in our community's economic future."
- If "Resident" ‚Üí b3c: "Residents are the heart of what makes our neighborhood special."
(All ‚Üí b4: next question)

RATING QUESTIONS - Branch on sentiment when context suggests follow-up:
- Low (1-4) ‚Üí Acknowledge concern + ask specific follow-up (b5a: "I'm sorry to hear that. What's the biggest challenge?" ‚Üí b6)
- High (8-10) ‚Üí Celebrate + ask what works (b5b: "That's wonderful! What's working well for you?" ‚Üí b6)
- Mid (5-7) ‚Üí Can skip acknowledgment or simple "thank you" (‚Üí b6 directly or via b5c)

TEXT QUESTIONS - Acknowledge after important/emotional questions:
- After sharing challenges: "Thank you for being honest about that."
- After sharing ideas: "I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts."

WHEN TO ADD ACKNOWLEDGMENT BRANCHES:
- First questions (relationship, role, identity) ‚Üí **Almost always branch**
- Key demographics or positioning questions ‚Üí **Usually branch**
- Rating questions ‚Üí Branch when you want to probe into the reason
- Mid-survey transitions ‚Üí Optional acknowledgment helps pacing
- Final questions ‚Üí Linear flow is fine

Make acknowledgments:
- Natural and conversational (matching the specified tone)
- Specific to their answer choice
- Aligned with context from the documents
- Brief (1-2 sentences max)

# SCALE/RATING FORMAT
For rating questions, use "scale" type with emoji options:
{
  "type": "scale",
  "content": "How satisfied are you?",
  "variable": "rating_3",
  "options": [
    { "id": "1", "value": "1", "label": "Not satisfied", "emoji": "üòû" },
    { "id": "2", "value": "2", "label": "2", "emoji": "üòû" },
    ...
    { "id": "10", "value": "10", "label": "Very satisfied", "emoji": "ü§©" }
  ],
  "next": "b4"
}

Emoji guide:
- 1-3: üòû (sad)
- 4-5: üòê (neutral)
- 6-7: üôÇ (slight smile)
- 8-9: üòä (smile)
- 10: ü§© (star eyes)

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Use 70-80% of the time budget (${maxMinutes} minutes)
2. Include: warm intro, 8-12 substantive questions, periodic acknowledgments
3. Match the tone: ${tone.join(', ')}
4. All block IDs referenced in "next" or "goto" must exist
5. Options must have kebab-case IDs
6. Variable names must be unique and follow naming conventions
7. Every non-end block must have a valid "next" field
8. Prioritize depth and insights aligned with document goals
